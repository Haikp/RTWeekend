The textbook I am following for this repo is Ray Tracing in One Weekend by Peter Shirley, to which the intended duration as stated by the title is meant to be covered in a weekend, however it is apparent that my understanding cpp is terrible, and I'm sure it would take a weekend only if I was proficient in OOP. Given such, I want to take my time and understand more than just ray tracing, and try reason with how the author organizes his code, so I can hopefully improve my cpp skills.
